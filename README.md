# 🚀 About Me

Hi! 👋 I'm Felipe, I initially studied Culinary Arts, obtaining a degree in that field.

I'm a person who is always craving for new knowledge, professional and personal growth, so in 2024 I decided to reinvent myself. I started a new journey in an area I was always passionate about: programming.

As part of my training in this new web development career, I developed competencies in many technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Git, NodeJS, Express, NestJS, React, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and working frameworks like Agile working and Scrum.

Being a person attracted to order and logic, I specialized in BackEnd development. I believe that every solution to most problems can be found in an organized database architecture and a clean business logic.

I firmly believe that these two aspects of programming are the core of every solution, and my plan is to master them.

I consider that my background in previous careers and works, brought me a critical way of thinking, strong analytic skills, quick learning, and great communication.

These skills, matched with my experience in customer service and sales, allow me to bring a comprehensive understanding of user experience, business needs, and production processes.

I bring to the table not only the ability to write clean and efficient code, but also the mindset to solve real-world problems, communicate effectively across teams, adapt quickly to change, and stay focused on delivering value. My goal is to contribute to projects where technology, creativity, and human understanding come together to create impactful solutions.
